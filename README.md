# Homework 4

## Homework 4 takes the home page of the travel-fly page and introduces media queries down to 800px width. The things that were changed consisted of moving the Tours pages into a column. This also made the Nav and Footers stretch to fit the with the screen as it shrinks. Finally the text form was changed to be column based and scale with the shrinking of the screen.
